## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

No build tools required! This is a static website that can be edited with any text editor.

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutryx-lab/neutryx-lab.github.io.git
cd neutryx-lab.github.io
```

2. Open in your preferred editor:

```bash
code .  # VS Code
# or simply open the HTML files in your browser
```

3. Serve locally (optional):

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Making Changes

- Edit HTML files directly for content updates
- CSS is embedded in `<style>` tags within each HTML file
- JavaScript is embedded in `<script>` tags (see [core.html](core.html) for demo logic)
